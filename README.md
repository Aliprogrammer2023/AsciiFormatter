# AsciiFormatter
I this version(version 3) I added a feature that you can create and view your ascii format input in an ASCII art animation. After determining your tendency to 
converting the ASCII input to txt or png file, you can determine whether you want to create the animated ASCII art. If it is yes, enter y and n for no. Then you can 
determine the frame and animation speed number. You can enter every positive integer for frame and positive decimal number for animation speed.
